<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an assingment I completed towards the end of my Software Engineering Certificate. I have struggled a bit with deploying this project.

Currently the App has several simple features: 

* View + search Companies and Jobs
* Create a User Account to 'apply' to jobs 

This repo only contains the front end. You can see the backend <a href="https://github.com/natesmith21/react-jobly-backend/tree/main
">here</a>

This is a very simple app and I know it has a lot of room for improvement. This isn't a project I plan to put more work into, because it isn't very useful with fake information. That said, a few notable improvements this app needs are: 

* Deployment Issues -- This issue will be addressed. 
* The 'Register' page is buried and not easy to access as a new user
* It's UI is ugly
* there is no real application attached to the 'apply' button - it just marks a yes/no in the db
